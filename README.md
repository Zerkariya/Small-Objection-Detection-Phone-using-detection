# Small-Objection-Detection-Phone-using-detection

#### This repo contaisn the project of small obejct detection--phone using detection files


#### Folder 1: state-farm-distracted-driver-detection

- data source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data
- Please unzip the dataset under the same directory with project.ipynb
- To be clear, the code has to be run with Tensorflow and Keras above version 2.8. The related conda environemnt file is attached. You could create a conda virtual environment and run it. 
- The code was run on Colab before, please remember to change the directory in notebook. The test datasets are not used since they are unannotated. The train dataset is used as the whole dataset.
- Further, in model=Sequential part, you can change line 4 as pretrained_model or base_model to decide run vgg16 or mobilenetv2. It's quite straightforward. If you want, you could add data augmentation between layers.Rescaling and pretrained_model to see different performance.
- The final performance is generated by accuracy and loss. 
- If you still cannot use the introduced envrionment, you could do pip install protobuf==3.20.* under that environmetn to solve the issue.
